## Your first model

Models represent the structure of your data and are used to simplify and
strongly type your backend interactions.

### Defining a model

To declare a model, you just need to use the `makeModel` function.
This function takes up to 2 arguments:

- The model `type`, which is used by other services to identify your model
or interact with a data source.
- The model `definition`, which contains your attributes/relations
definitions and custom properties and methods.

```ts title="models/post.ts"
// file: models/comment.ts noEmit
import { makeModel } from 'func-client/core';
export default class Comment extends makeModel('comments') {}

// file: models/post.ts
import { makeModel, attr, hasMany, toDate } from 'func-client/core';
import type Comment from './comment';

export default class Post extends makeModel('posts', {
  title: attr<string>(),
  description: attr<string>(),
  publishedAt: attr<Date | undefined>(toDate()),
  comments: hasMany<Comment>(),
  get isDraft() {
    return !this.publishedAt;
  },
}) {
}
```

:::tip
If you never need to import only a model's type (such as in Typescript to
avoid circular deps), you can directly use the `makeModel` returned value
instead of extending it: `export default makeModel('posts', {});`

### Using models classes

Model classes can be used as any classical ES6 class. It can be instantiated,
manipulated, etc. Properties will be defined on each instance from the model
definition.

```javascript
const post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello World!';
console.log(post.title); // "Hello World!"
console.log(post.isDraft); // true
console.log(post.exists); // false
```

## Your first actions

### Action factory with blueprints

Once your models are set up, you will probably want to interact with a
data source, such as an API.
For this, you will need an action factory which initialize a preconfigured
context for all your future actions.
Running actions using this action factory will be seen in the
[next part of this guide](#running-simple-actions).

Blueprints provide a quick initialization of your action factory for different
common use-cases. Currently, you may choose between the two available
blueprints: [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org) or JSON REST.

<Tabs groupId="implementation">
  <TabItem
    value="jsonapi"
    label="JSON:API"
    default
  >

`makeJsonApi` is a blueprint to quickly initiate an action factory to
interact with a normalized [JSON:API backend](https://jsonapi.org).
It provides all the available tooling, such as a model registry, an instance
cache, a serializer and deserializer and an adapter.

You can read more details on this implementation on the
[JSON:API details page](/docs/advanced/jsonapi-details).

```javascript title="action.js"
import { makeJsonApi } from 'func-client/blueprints';
import Comment from './models/comment';
import Post from './models/post';

const { makeAction, registry } = makeJsonApi({
  baseURL: 'https://example.com/api/v1',
});

// We need to register the models to allow the deserializer to know
// to which model it should deserialize from an API record.
registry.register(Comment, Post, /* User, Tag */);

export default function action() {
  return makeAction();
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem
    value="jsonrest"
    label="JSON REST"
  >

`makeJsonRest` is a blueprint to quickly initiate an action factory to
interact with a normalized JSON REST backend.
It provides all the available tooling, such as a model registry, an instance
cache, a serializer and deserializer and an adapter.

You can read more details on this implementation on the
[JSON REST details page](/docs/advanced/jsonrest-details).

```javascript title="action.js"
import { makeJsonRest } from 'func-client/blueprints';
import Comment from './models/comment';
import Post from './models/post';

const { makeAction, registry } = makeJsonRest({
  baseURL: 'https://example.com/api/v1',
});

// We need to register the models to allow the deserializer to know
// to which model it should deserialize from an API record.
registry.register(Comment, Post, /* User, Tag */);

export default function action() {
  return makeAction();
}
```

  </TabItem>

:::danger Whoops
For the moment, there is no other official implementation available besides
JSON:API and JSON REST.

You should open an issue or a pull request on the
[**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/paul-thebaud/func-client/issues)
to submit your implementation idea.

#### Notice on blueprints

Using blueprints is a simple and quick way to set up an action factory.
However, it may have some downsides:

- Only some implementations are available for now, so you may not found
something which fits your needs
- Some dependencies (e.g. serializer in a readonly context) may imported
even if you don't use them, and it may increase your production bundle size;
- Some behaviors may not be configurable;

If you want more control over your action factory and its dependencies, you should read
[**the advanced guide on custom action factory**](/docs/advanced/custom-action-factory).

### Running simple actions

To run an action, you can initialize a new action instance by calling your factory.
With this instance, you can call **context enhancers** through `use` to modify
the action context.
When you are ready, you can `run` the action with a given **context runner**.

```javascript
import { all, model } from 'func-client/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const posts = await action()
  .use(model(Post))
  .run(all());
```

Generally in FuncClient, the context enhancers are doing the majority of work to
customize the action you will run. Context runners only exists to tell how
you wish to run the action and retrieve the result (raw result, model instance,
etc.).

A great example of this is when finding a model using its ID. You'll not use
a `find` context runner. Instead, you will need to use a `find` context
enhancer and a `oneOrFail` context runner. This way, you are able to do
a find query and retrieve a raw result when needed.

```javascript
import { find, oneOrFail } from 'func-client/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const post = await action()
  .use(find(Post, 'abc-123'))
  .run(oneOrFail());
```

This works the same to send write operations through actions. In the following
example, we are retrieving a raw adapter response instead of model instances.

```javascript
import { create, fill, oneOrCurrent } from 'func-client/core';
import Post from './models/post';
import action from './action';

const post = fill(new Post(), {
  title: 'Hello World!',
  description: 'Your first post',
});

const response = await action()
  .use(create(post))
  .run(oneOrCurrent());
```

### Running HTTP custom actions

Using JSON:API or JSON REST blueprints, you may also want to use FuncClient
to make non-standard API calls.

```javascript
import { instance, raw } from 'func-client/core';
import { makePost } from 'func-client/http';
import action from './action';

const post = await action()
  .use(find(Post, 'abc-123'))
  .run(oneOrFail());

// Make a POST call to "https://example.com/api/v1/services/posts/1/publish"
// Admitting it returns: {"message":"Successfully published post."}
const response = await action()
  .use(instance(post))
  .use(makePost('publish', {
    data: { publishedAt: new Date() },
  }))
  .run(raw());

console.log(response.status); // 204
```

This way, you can standardize all API calls across your application, even when
those are non JSON:API/JSON REST related.
